//topcoder : zigzag sequence
/*
  A sequence of numbers is called a zig-zag sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative.
  The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a zig-zag sequence.

  For example, 1,7,4,9,2,5 is a zig-zag sequence because the differences (6,-3,5,-7,3) are alternately positive and negative. 
  In contrast, 1,4,7,2,5 and 1,7,4,5,5 are not zig-zag sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and 
  the second because its last difference is zero.
  Given a sequence of integers, sequence, return the length of the longest subsequence of sequence that is a zig-zag sequence. 
  A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.
